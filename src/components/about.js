    'The Shoubridge laboratory at the McGill University in Montreal has a long-standing experience in finding the genetic cause of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies in both adults and children. The laboratoryâ€™s interest lies in deciphering the function of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins and their role in mitochondrial disease pathology at a molecular level. More recently, we are using BioID, a proximity biotinylation assay, to create a mitochondrial interaction network, in order to study interfaces between mitochondria and other cellular compartments, as well as functional context of newly identified proteins within mitochondrial RNA granules.',
